# E-commerce Sales Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict sales for an e-commerce platform using historical transaction data. By analyzing various features such as product category, price, and promotional activities, we employ machine learning models to forecast future sales, enabling better inventory and marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes:

- **Product Information**: Category, price, and promotional details.
- **Transaction Data**: Date, quantity sold, and sales amount.
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, location, and purchasing behavior.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns and insights through visualizations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables to improve model performance.
4. **Modeling**: Implementing machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Results

The models developed provide insights into sales trends and can predict future sales with reasonable accuracy. These predictions can assist in optimizing inventory management and marketing efforts.
